> 1. Photos application on Window
> 2. Airdisk app on iPhone

1. Connect your USB drive to your iPhone using a Lightning to USB adapter or a USB-C connector, depending on your iPhone model.
2. Open the Photos app on your iPhone.
3. Select the photos you want to copy (you can use "Select All" if desired).
4. Tap the Share button and choose "Export Unmodified Original" or "Save to Files."
5. In the Files app, choose your connected USB drive as the destination and tap "Save."
6. Safely eject the USB drive from the Files app before disconnecting.

Some USB flash drives have companion apps (like SanDisk iXpand) that can facilitate faster or automatic transfers.

This method allows direct copying without the need for a computer intermediary, though selecting many photos at once may be tedious depending on your needs and iOS version.[1][2][3][4][5]
